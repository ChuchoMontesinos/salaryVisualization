This is my first visualization on python using a database from _Kaggle_

1. I check the data and delete all the rows with `NaN` datatypes
2. Create visualizations using a single feature like the number of people of certain age, education level and number of men and women
3. Create visualizations mixing features like the salary, and create the visualizations of the average salary of the people according to its gender and according to their education level
